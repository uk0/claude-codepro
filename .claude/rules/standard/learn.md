## Online Learning System

**Rule:** Automatically evaluate and extract reusable knowledge after significant tasks.

### Automatic Invocation (MANDATORY)

After completing ANY task involving these triggers, **invoke `/learn`**:

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Non-obvious debugging** | Spent 10+ minutes investigating; solution wasn't in docs |
| **Misleading errors** | Error message pointed wrong direction; found real cause |
| **Workarounds** | Discovered limitation and found creative solution |
| **Tool integration** | Figured out how to use tool/API in undocumented way |
| **Trial-and-error** | Tried multiple approaches before finding what worked |

### Quick Self-Check

After significant tasks, ask yourself:
- "What did I just learn that wasn't obvious before starting?"
- "Would future-me benefit from having this documented?"

**If YES → Invoke `/learn` immediately.**

### What NOT to Extract

- Routine tasks with documented solutions
- One-off fixes unlikely to recur
- Knowledge easily found in official docs
- Unverified or theoretical solutions

### The Goal

**Continuous, autonomous improvement.** Every valuable discovery should benefit future sessions.
Failing to evaluate means knowledge is lost forever.
